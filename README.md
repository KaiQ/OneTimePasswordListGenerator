# OneTimePasswordListGenerator

This little tool can generate Lists of One Time Passwords.
I share this list with friends and use it for symmetric encryption.

At this Version the tool uses only /dev/urandom as source of randomness. You ar free to use /dev/random or an other source.

You need  Latex and a UNIX like enviroment to run this.

To make a password List run "make".
